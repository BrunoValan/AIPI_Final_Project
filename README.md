# AIPI FInal Project
This is the repository for my final project for AIPI 540 - Deep Learning. This project explores 90 Day returns to the emergency department in orthopaedic patients at Duke University. Note their is no data in this Data folder as it is patient information. While it is de-identified it must continue to be held on Duke servers protected by a firewall. Please contact the authors of this project if you are interested in continuing to work with this dataset at bruno.valan@duke.edu
